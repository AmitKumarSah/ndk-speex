This will probably give you a buildable project:

$ android update project --path speexjni

Then 

# cd speexjni
# ant debug
# ndk-build  # this tool is in your android-ndk-* directory

If anyone happens to know how to rig things so that the ant build
process does the ndk-build for you, let me know.
